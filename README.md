# **BS Video Player for Flutter**

This plugin provides a customisable video player widget that can be used to display video content in a Flutter app. The [bs_video_player](http://https://pub.dev/packages/bs_video_player "bs_video_player package") package utilizes the [video_player](http://https://pub.dev/packages/video_player "video_player") plugin for video playback in Flutter applications. While video_player provides direct access to video playback functions, [bs_video_player](http://https://pub.dev/packages/bs_video_player "bs_video_player") wraps this functionality in an easy-to-use Material interface.
